# HD-Sydsvenskan JavaScript Core

Contains additional rules which we use on top of [Standard JS](https://standardjs.com/) in our linting setups for browser js, node, typescript and such.

Include this config after the [Standard JS ESLint config](https://github.com/standard/eslint-config-standard). Bundles the [Semistandard](https://github.com/standard/eslint-config-semistandard) modifications.
